# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest released version of RuleScribe receives security fixes. The
plugin is distributed through the JetBrains Marketplace and as GitHub release
artifacts; always run the most recent build.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| latest  | ✅        |
| older   | ❌        |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities **privately**, not through public
issues:

- Open a private advisory via GitHub Security Advisories (repository
  *Security* tab → *Report a vulnerability*).

Please include the affected version, a description of the issue and its
impact, and reproduction steps or a proof of concept if available. You can
expect an initial acknowledgement within **7 days**; once a fix is released,
credit is given to the reporter unless anonymity is requested.

## Why RuleScribe is low-risk by construction

RuleScribe is an editor-only language plugin. Its attack surface is
deliberately minimal:

- **Zero third-party runtime dependencies.** The shipped artifact bundles no
  third-party libraries. The only declared dependency (JUnit) is test-scoped
  and never distributed; the Kotlin standard library and all PSI/UI APIs are
  provided by the host IntelliJ Platform at runtime. This is verified
  continuously: the OWASP scan runs against the plugin's **shipped** runtime
  classpath and reports **0 dependencies, 0 vulnerabilities**. Your users are
  therefore never exposed to a transitive dependency vulnerability through
  RuleScribe.
- **No network access.** The plugin makes no outbound network calls of its
  own — no telemetry, no downloads, no phone-home. It only reads the `.rules`
  files already open in the project.
- **No code execution.** It statically parses and inspects DSL text. It never
  executes rules, KEL expressions, or any user-supplied code.
- **No access to credentials or secrets.** It reads only the `.rules` source
  files in the editor.

## Automated security & quality assurance

Every change is checked automatically in GitHub Actions:

| Tool | What it checks | When |
| ---- | -------------- | ---- |
| **CodeQL** | Static analysis (SAST) of the Kotlin/Java code | push, PR, weekly |
| **poutine** (BoostSecurity) | CI/CD pipeline misconfigurations — injection, unsafe triggers, supply-chain | push, PR, weekly |
| **Dependabot** | Vulnerable dependencies (alerts) + dependency/action updates | continuous / weekly |
| **OWASP Dependency-Check** | Known CVEs in shipped dependencies; **fails the build on CVSS ≥ 7.0** | weekly, on demand |
| **IntelliJ Plugin Verifier** | Binary compatibility across IntelliJ versions; opens an issue on breakage | weekly, on demand |

Findings from CodeQL and poutine are published to GitHub **code scanning**
(Security tab). The OWASP scan is scoped to the shipped runtime classpath;
build- and test-time dependencies (JUnit, the IntelliJ Platform SDK) are not
distributed and are out of scope — platform libraries are patched by JetBrains
through IDE updates.

## Supply-chain & CI/CD hardening

The build and release pipeline follows current supply-chain best practices:

- **Least-privilege workflows.** Each workflow declares the minimum
  `permissions` it needs; the repository's default token is read-only.
- **No untrusted code execution in privileged contexts.** Automation runs on
  `pull_request` (never `pull_request_target`), never checks out or runs a
  pull request's code with secrets available, and never interpolates untrusted
  input into shell commands — neutralising the "pwn request" class of attacks
  (independently scanned for by poutine).
- **Hardened Dependabot auto-merge.** Only patch/minor updates auto-merge, and
  only after the required CI checks pass; the author is verified via the
  non-forgeable `pull_request.user.login` field.
- **Isolated publishing.** The JetBrains Marketplace token is exposed only to
  the tag-triggered publish job — never to pull-request workflows — so it
  cannot be exfiltrated by a malicious pull request. Publishing is gated: tests
  and plugin verification must pass before anything is released.

## Provenance & distribution

- Releases are built and published **only** by CI, from an explicit version
  **tag** — never from arbitrary commits.
- Every upload is **re-verified server-side by JetBrains** on the Marketplace.
  Recent releases are verified **Compatible with IntelliJ IDEA 2024.1 through
  2026.2** (Plugin Verifier plus a real IDE run, no issues).
- Source, build configuration, and every CI/CD workflow are fully public and
  auditable in this repository.
