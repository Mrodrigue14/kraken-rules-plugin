## Supported versions

Only the latest released version of RuleScribe receives security fixes. The
plugin is distributed through the JetBrains Marketplace and as GitHub release
artifacts; always run the most recent build.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| latest  | ✅        |
| older   | ❌        |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities **privately**, not through public
issues:

- Open a private advisory via GitHub Security Advisories (repository
  *Security* tab → *Report a vulnerability*).

Please include the affected version, a description of the issue and its
impact, and reproduction steps or a proof of concept if available. You can
expect an initial acknowledgement within **7 days**; once a fix is released,
credit is given to the reporter unless anonymity is requested.

## Why RuleScribe is low-risk by construction

RuleScribe is an editor-only language plugin. Its attack surface is
deliberately minimal:

- **Zero third-party runtime dependencies.** The shipped artifact bundles no
  third-party libraries. The only declared dependency (JUnit) is test-scoped
  and never distributed; the Kotlin standard library and all PSI/UI APIs are
  provided by the host IntelliJ Platform at runtime. This is verified
  continuously: the OWASP scan runs against the plugin's **shipped** runtime
  classpath and reports **0 dependencies, 0 vulnerabilities**. Your users are
  therefore never exposed to a transitive dependency vulnerability through
  RuleScribe. This is not only prose: each release ships a **CycloneDX SBOM**
  scoped to the same runtime classpath, so the claim is checkable by your own
  tooling rather than taken on trust.
- **No network access — verified, not asserted.** The plugin makes no outbound
  network calls of its own: no telemetry, no downloads, no phone-home. It only
  reads the `.rules` files already open in the project. This is enforced by a
  test (`KrakenNoNetworkEgressTest`) that scans every shipped class and **fails
  the build** if any references a network API (sockets, HTTP clients, URL
  connections, common third-party HTTP libraries). Adding telemetry or any
  outbound call would break CI before it could reach a release — so a
  data-sensitive adopter can rely on "no egress" as a checked property of each
  build rather than a promise.
- **No code execution.** It statically parses and inspects DSL text. It never
  executes rules, KEL expressions, or any user-supplied code.
- **No access to credentials or secrets.** It reads only the `.rules` source
  files in the editor.

## Automated security & quality assurance

Every change is checked automatically in GitHub Actions:

| Tool | What it checks | When |
| ---- | -------------- | ---- |
| **CodeQL** | Static analysis (SAST) of the Kotlin/Java code, `security-and-quality` suite | push, PR, weekly |
| **poutine** (BoostSecurity) | CI/CD pipeline misconfigurations — injection, unsafe triggers, supply-chain | push, PR, weekly |
| **Dependabot** | Vulnerable dependencies (alerts) + dependency/action updates | continuous / weekly |
| **Dependency Review** | **Blocks a PR** that introduces a dependency with a high-severity CVE or a denied (copyleft) license | every PR |
| **OWASP Dependency-Check** | Known CVEs in shipped dependencies; **fails the build on CVSS ≥ 7.0** | weekly, on demand |
| **IntelliJ Plugin Verifier** | Binary compatibility across IntelliJ versions; opens an issue on breakage | weekly, on demand |

Findings from CodeQL and poutine are published to GitHub **code scanning**
(Security tab). The OWASP scan is scoped to the shipped runtime classpath;
build- and test-time dependencies (JUnit, the IntelliJ Platform SDK) are not
distributed and are out of scope — platform libraries are patched by JetBrains
through IDE updates.

These features are part of **GitHub Advanced Security** (free for public
repositories): code scanning (CodeQL), dependency review, Dependabot alerts,
and secret scanning with push protection. Together they cover software
composition analysis (vulnerabilities **and** license policy) and secret
leakage — the GitHub-native equivalent of a dedicated SCA product's core
checks. Deep artifact/registry scanning and runtime analysis are out of scope
for an editor plugin that ships no third-party binaries.

### OWASP Top 10 coverage

CodeQL runs the **`security-and-quality`** suite
(`.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`), which is a **superset** of CodeQL's
security queries — the built-in suites are nested:

```
code-scanning (default)  ⊂  security-extended  ⊂  security-and-quality
```

An "OWASP Top 10" query suite is a *filter* selecting queries carrying the
corresponding CWE tags, so it is by construction a **subset** of what already
runs here. Adding it would duplicate findings rather than detect anything new.

Coverage is verifiable rather than asserted: every CodeQL alert carries its
`external/cwe/cwe-NNN` tag, so results can be filtered and reported by CWE —
and therefore mapped to OWASP Top 10 categories — directly in the
**Security → Code scanning** view.

## Supply-chain & CI/CD hardening

The build and release pipeline follows current supply-chain best practices:

- **Least-privilege workflows.** Each workflow declares the minimum
  `permissions` it needs; the repository's default token is read-only.
- **No untrusted code execution in privileged contexts.** Automation runs on
  `pull_request` (never `pull_request_target`), never checks out or runs a
  pull request's code with secrets available, and never interpolates untrusted
  input into shell commands — neutralising the "pwn request" class of attacks
  (independently scanned for by poutine).
- **Protected default branch, with no exemption for the maintainer.** Every
  change to `main` must go through a pull request whose required status checks
  (build & tests, CodeQL) pass. This is enforced by a repository ruleset whose
  **bypass list is empty** — direct pushes to `main` are rejected for everyone,
  including the repository owner. Force pushes and branch deletion are blocked,
  so history cannot be rewritten after the fact.
- **Hardened Dependabot auto-merge.** Only patch/minor updates auto-merge, and
  only after the required CI checks pass; the author is verified via the
  non-forgeable `pull_request.user.login` field.
- **Isolated publishing.** The JetBrains Marketplace token is exposed only to
  the tag-triggered publish job — never to pull-request workflows — so it
  cannot be exfiltrated by a malicious pull request. Publishing is gated: tests
  and plugin verification must pass before anything is released.

## Release integrity — verify it yourself

Releases are produced by CI from an explicit version **tag**. The pipeline runs
the tests and the plugin verifier, builds the artifact, **signs** it,
re-verifies that signature against the publisher certificate, scans dependencies
with OWASP, and attests the result — in that order, before anything is
published. Source, build configuration, and every CI/CD workflow are public and
auditable in this repository.

Two independent guarantees ship with each release:

- A **signed SLSA build provenance attestation** binds the distributed `.zip` to
  the exact commit, workflow, and runner that produced it. It proves *the
  pipeline built this exact file*.
- A **cryptographic plugin signature** (JetBrains plugin signing) proves *it
  comes from this publisher and has not been altered*. A malformed or mismatched
  key fails the release rather than shipping a worthless signature.

These describe the same artifact: the file that is signed is the file that is
attested, and it is the file published to the Marketplace. You do not have to
take any of it on trust:

```
gh attestation verify rulescribe-<version>.zip \
  --repo Mrodrigue14/RuleScribe-plugin-for-kraken-rules
```

This works on the artifact downloaded from the **JetBrains Marketplace** as
well as from GitHub Releases. An artifact uploaded out-of-band — hand-uploaded,
bypassing the checks — has no valid attestation and **fails** verification.

The signature is verifiable too. Each GitHub Release attaches the publisher
certificate (`rulescribe-signing-certificate.crt`) — a certificate is public
material; the private key never leaves GitHub Actions secrets. Check the
artifact against it with JetBrains'
[marketplace-zip-signer](https://github.com/JetBrains/marketplace-zip-signer):

```
java -jar marketplace-zip-signer-cli.jar verify \
  -in rulescribe-<version>-signed.zip \
  -cert rulescribe-signing-certificate.crt
```

Each release also states the certificate's SHA-256 fingerprint in its notes.
It is identical across releases signed with the same key, so you can confirm
that a new release comes from the same publishing identity as the one you
already trust. A changed fingerprint means the identity changed — and would be
announced rather than slipped in.

To be precise about what this proves: the certificate is **self-signed**, so it
attests integrity and continuity — this artifact was not altered, and it comes
from the same key as previous releases — not an identity vouched for by a
certificate authority.

### Inventory, not just a verdict

Each release also carries a **CycloneDX SBOM** (`rulescribe-sbom-<version>.json`),
attested and therefore bound to that exact artifact:

```
gh attestation verify rulescribe-<version>-signed.zip \
  --repo Mrodrigue14/RuleScribe-plugin-for-kraken-rules \
  --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom
```

It complements the OWASP report rather than duplicating it. The OWASP report is
a **verdict**: accurate the day it was produced, and it ages as new CVEs are
published. The SBOM is an **inventory**: it does not age, and it lets you
re-scan any release against your own vulnerability feed at any time, on your
schedule rather than ours.

Both are scoped to the runtime classpath — what the `.zip` actually ships. An
unscoped SBOM would list the IntelliJ Platform SDK, JUnit and the Kotlin
compiler: build-time dependencies that are never distributed, and listing them
would contradict the zero-dependency result above rather than inform you.

Every upload is additionally re-verified server-side by JetBrains on the
Marketplace; recent releases are verified **Compatible with IntelliJ IDEA
2024.1 through 2026.2** (Plugin Verifier plus a real IDE run, no issues).

### What this does not claim

Because the plugin is maintained on a personal Marketplace account, an
out-of-band upload is not technically *impossible*. It is instead made
**detectable and unverifiable**:

- Each pipeline release leaves a public, auditable chain — git tag → CI run →
  signature → provenance attestation → OWASP report with its SHA-256 →
  JetBrains server-side verification.
- A scheduled **release-integrity** workflow
  (`.github/workflows/release-integrity.yml`) compares the latest Marketplace
  version against the pipeline's releases every day and opens an issue if a
  version appears without a corresponding attested release.

In short: don't take our word for it — **any published version is verifiable,
and any deviation is surfaced automatically.**
